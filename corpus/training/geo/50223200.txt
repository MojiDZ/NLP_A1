== Development ==

The second version has been operational since May 2019.


== Description ==
The data are published in four forms : table, graph, general map and thematic map.


=== Tables ===
Tables show statistical data dynamically in a tooltip. The number of socio-economic indicators varies according to administrative divisions : 123 for the provincial level, 47 for a prefecture and 40 for a district.  The indicators cover various fields: geography, population, administrative divisions, finance, trade, energy, natural resources, agricultural and industrial production, education, tourism, etc.


=== Graphs ===
This atlas offers six types of graphical representation of statistical data : line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, box plots and dot plots. Statistical variables change dynamically based on administrative divisions. Graphic parameters are also customizable.


=== General maps ===
The maps are interactive and published on five scales. The first four scales correspond to administrative levels of province, prefecture, district and village, and the last one shows the topographic map of the region. Geographic entities represented in the maps include administrative divisions, cities, villages, transport, water systems, agriculture, forestry, livestock, industry, geomorphology, tourism and others.


=== Thematic maps ===
Four types of map are possible: choropleth, pie plot, dot-density map and bar plots. The cartographic choices are imposed to the user and can't derogate from graphic semiology. 43 themes are available for the years from 1949 to 2014. Users produce thematic maps interactively based on selected themes and map settings.
