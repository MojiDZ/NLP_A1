== History ==
Jim Leniart is the owner and creator of Red Maps.  He began his career in commercial real estate drawing maps for clients.  Jim's decision to become a full-time cartographer led to the creation of Red Maps, which he founded in 1998.  Beginning with a shopping guide to SoHo, by June 2000, two additional New York guides for Midtown and all of Manhattan, as well as maps to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas were completed.  In April 2001, Red Maps was named one of the Best Map Guides for San Francisco by Travel + Leisure. There are over 29 Red Maps to 24 cities.
