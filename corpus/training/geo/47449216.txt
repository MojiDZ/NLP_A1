Navionics is an Italian manufacturer of electronic navigational charts, headquartered in Massarosa, Italy. The company operates worldwide with subsidiaries in Wareham, Massachusetts, Plymouth (United Kingdom), Hyderabad (India) and New South Wales (Australia).
Navionics was founded in 1984, when Giuseppe Carnevali and Fosco Bianchetti introduced the world's first marine electronic chart plotter, the Geonav. In 2007, Navionics sold the Geonav product line, to focus solely on the production of electronic charts.
On October 27, 2017, Navionics was acquired by Garmin Ltd.
In 2018, it was reported that Navionics had exposed hundreds of thousands of customer records, when its MongoDB database wasn't secured with a password.
