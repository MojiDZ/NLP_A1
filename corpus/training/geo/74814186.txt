The Living Indus Initiative, serving as an overarching program and a rallying call to action, seeks to spearhead and unify various efforts aimed at revitalizing the ecological well-being of the Indus River  within Pakistan's borders. It emerges as a direct response to Pakistan's heightened susceptibility to the adverse effects of climate change.


== Background ==
The primary goal of the Living Indus Initiative is to safeguard, preserve, and rehabilitate the diverse natural ecosystems found in the Indus Basin, including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine environments. This initiative is dedicated to the revitalization and recovery of the basin's natural resources and ecosystems, with a specific focus on enhancing their ability to withstand the challenges posed by climate change.


== Strategies ==
The Living Indus Initiative has pinpointed 25 initial interventions that center on nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. These interventions were identified after thorough consultations involving input from the public sector, private sector, experts, and civil society.
