== History ==
Hunter produces pop-up gear-driven rotors, spray sprinklers, valves, controllers, central controllers, and weather sensors. The company reports that it holds more than 250 product patents and 40 trademarks, and conducts business in 125 countries. The company was founded in 1981 by Edwin J. Hunter and Paul M. Hunter, to produce a compact landscape sprinkler called the "PGP" (an acronym meaning "professional gear-driven pop-up"), the first sprinkler to utilize "matched-precipitation" regardless of the radii or arc. After being President and CEO for 19 years, Edwin Hunter retired in February 2013 and was succeeded by his son, Richard E. Hunter.The company's irrigation and landscape lighting products are used in a wide array of locations including sports stadiums, national landmarks, hotels, and city parks.  Manufacturing facilities are located in San Marcos, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, and the company also has overseas offices in China. An additional plant had been in operation in Cary, NC, from 1992 to 2009, but the plant was closed due to poor market conditions at the time.In 2016, the Center for Executive Excellence (CEE) recognized Hunter Industries as one of twelve companies that excelled in promoting a successful business culture.

== Arson ==
On October 26, 2003, an arson fire damaged the main manufacturing plant in San Marcos, causing US$17 million in damages.  Fires had been started in 8 locations of the building using accelerants, most likely by a disgruntled employee or ex-employee, causing damage to inventory and production areas.  As of 2006, no one had been prosecuted for the crime, but the fire provided the company the opportunity to modernize and to expand its operations. At the October 2006 reopening, CEO Richard Hunter announced, "Today is a celebration of total recovery from an event that easily could have destroyed our companyâ€¦instead it made us bigger, better, stronger."
