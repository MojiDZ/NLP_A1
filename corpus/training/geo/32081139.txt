== About ==
An ecosystem is a biological environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving, physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight. It is all the organisms in a given area, along with the nonliving (abiotic) factors with which they interact; a biological community and its physical environment. As stated in an article from Montana State University in their Institute on Ecosystems; "An ecosystem can be small, such as the area under a pine tree or a single hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, or it can be large, such as the Rocky Mountains, the rainforest or the Antarctic Ocean." The Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) have shared their views on Montana's Main Ecosystems as montane forest, intermountain grasslands, plains grasslands and shrub grasslands. The Montana Agricultural Experiment Station (MAES) categorized Montana's ecosystems based on the different rangelands. They have recognized 22 different ecosystems whereas the Montana Natural Heritage Program named 62 ecosystems for the entire state.
