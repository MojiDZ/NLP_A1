The Lebanese Marine and Wildlife Museum  (Arabic: المتحف اللبناني للحياة البحرية و البرية, al-matḥaf al-lubnani lil-hayat al-bahriya wa al-bariya) is a zoological museum in Jeita, and is one of the largest such museums in the middle east. Over 90% of the specimens in the museum were collected from Lebanon by Dr. Jamal Younes (president and owner of the museum).
Its main goals are to study Lebanon's ecosystem, encourage preservation, and maintain a scientific archive of Lebanon's wildlife and the Mediterranean marine life.

The Museum was first opened in Tyre in 2001 by Dr. Jamal Younes, who has been collecting and preserving specimens for more than 30 years. After the collection grew too large, there was no more space for some  specimens, so it was decided to construct a new museum large enough to display all the specimens in Jeita.
