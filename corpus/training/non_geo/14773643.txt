CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1), previously referred to as TORC1 (Transducer Of Regulated CREB activity 1),  is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CRTC1 gene. It is expressed in a limited number of tissues that include fetal brain and liver and adult heart, skeletal muscles, liver and salivary glands and various regions of the adult central nervous system.


== Clinical significance ==
Production of CRTC1 is blocked in Alzheimer's disease.
